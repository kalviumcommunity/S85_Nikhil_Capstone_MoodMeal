## 📌 Project Title: MoodMeal – Mood-Based Food Delivery App

---

## 🧠 Project Idea

**MoodMeal** is a MERN stack-based food delivery web app that recommends dishes based on the user’s *current mood*.  
Instead of endlessly browsing food items, users simply choose their mood — **Hungry, Sad, Lazy, Celebrating, Healthy** — and the app shows personalized food options to match that vibe.

This app aims to make food ordering fast, emotional, and super satisfying.

## 🛠️ 10-Day Daily Plan

### ✅ **Day 1 – Project Setup & Planning**
- Initialize Git repo and create project repo on `kalviumcommunity`
- Create base folders for backend and frontend (MERN skeleton)
- Connect MongoDB database (local or Atlas)
- Setup environment variables
- Write detailed `README.md`
- Push initial commit + open PR + request CodiumAI review

---

### ✅ **Day 2 – UI Wireframes & Mood Selection Page**
- Create rough wireframes for app pages (mood selection, food display, order page)
- Build `MoodSelector` component in React (UI only)
- Create a `moods.js` file for static list of moods
- Add mood-specific illustrations/icons

### ✅ **Day 3 – Backend Mood API + MongoDB Integration**
- Design schema for food items (name, type, moodTag, price, image)
- Seed dummy data into MongoDB (using Postman or script)

- Perform thorough testing for user flow: mood selection → food list → cart → order summary
- Debug any performance issues or bugs

---

### ✅ **Day 10 – Final Testing & Project Submission**
- Conduct final testing and QA
- Fix any remaining bugs or UI issues
- Merge GitHub branches and prepare for submission
- Record a final demo video of the app in action
